# Dashboard
Dashboard is a component of the Openbaton NFVO, which adds the Web GUI to it. It works as web pages provided by the inbuilt server of the NFVO.

# Technical Requirements
1. NFVO 
2. Webbrowser capable of interpeting HTML, Javascript and CSS

# How to install Dashboard

The project iself does not require any installation. However, if you want to change the component inside your NFVO, you will need to copy the contents into the dashboard subfolder inside the NFVO folder or edit the one that you have already. After this, recompile NFVO in order for it to be built with the updated version.

# How to use Dashboard

# How to extend Dashboard

You can add the pages to the GUI by simply adding them to the static resources folder of the component.

# What is Open Baton?

Open Baton is an open source project providing a comprehensive implementation of the ETSI Management and Orchestration (MANO) specification and the TOSCA Standard. Open Baton provides multiple mechanisms for interoperating with different VNFM vendor solutions. 
It has a modular archiecture which can be easily extended for supporting additional use cases. 

It integrates with OpenStack as standard de-facto VIM implementation, and provides a driver mechanism for supporting additional VIM types. It supports Network Service management either using the provided Generic VNFM and Juju VNFM, or integrating additional specific VNFMs. It provides several mechanisms (REST or PUB/SUB) for interoperating with external VNFMs. 

It can be combined with additional components (Monitoring, Fault Management, Autoscaling, and Network Slicing Engine) for building a unique MANO comprehensive solution.
